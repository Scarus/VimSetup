# VimSetup

My personal Vim setup

Global variable are declared in .vimrc file
it allows you some personal settings
(Your own name, nickname, shell of choice, set new path for templates files, ...)

Even if it's not perfect (What is?) the code is as dynamic as I can do,
so in case of modifications (modifying the templates' design for example), code modifications outside of .vimrc file should be minimal

Features:
Automatic File Header
Automatic Include Guard for .h and .hh files
Automatic Shebang for file scripts
Automatic execution permission for file scripts
Comment Macro
Uncomment Macro (coming soon)
Pre-filled Makefile
Functions allowing to:
- generate C/cpp main function
- generate C/cpp class (Coplien's form in progress)
- generate C/cpp structure
installation script (coming soon)
